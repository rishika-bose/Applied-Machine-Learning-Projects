Someone with cancer being undiagnosed (a false negative) could lead to the disease getting worse and therefore would be less desireable than someone being told they have cancer when they do not (a fase positive). As recall accounts for false negatives, whereas precision focuses on fase positives, recall is more informative for this problem.\n",

    "    Recall would be appropriate for this dataset, which has a target feature that classifies samples by whether they are likely to have a heart attack or not. If the   dataset was to be used to train a model that would identify which patients were likely to have a heart attack, false positives would usually not be as important as false negatives (as the patient may die if not identified). Therefore recall would be more important than f1, precision, or accuracy.\n",

    "    False negatives (saying an email is not spam when it is) could be very bad here, as it would lead the spam to end up in the inbox and could lead to annoyance or even danger of e.g. getting a virus. However, false positives could possibly be even worse, as a very strict spam filter may cause real (ham) emails to not appear in the inbox, which would be a big incovenience for the user. A model with a high number of false positives but very low number of false negatives may have a high accuracy, but this would be misleading about the usability of the model. In this case, f1 score may be more informative, as it considers bot precision and recall without assuming that false negatives and false positives have an equal cost (as accuracy does)."

This helps reduce redundancy in the processed dataset.\n",
